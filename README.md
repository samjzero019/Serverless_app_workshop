Hi there! Welcome to AWS Cloud9!

To get started, create some files, play with the terminal,
or visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/cloud9/ for our documentation.

Happy coding!

Labs:
This workshop is divided into five labs. Each lab is dependent on the previous one, therefore we recommend you not to skip or jump any of the labs.

Lab1: You will be creating synchronous REST API with all CRUD operations by using API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB
Lab2: You will be converting POST method to asynchronous method with SQS and Lambda Poller
Lab3: You will be adding step functions to orchestrate POST operations with additional Lambda functions.
Lab4: You will be adding authentication mechanism to your API Gateway, then it will only allow authenticated users to access API
Lab5: You will be using OAuth2 scopes for authorizing users in front of API Gateway.
